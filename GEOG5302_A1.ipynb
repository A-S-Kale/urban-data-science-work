        "Elevated levels of NOX and NO₂ are linked to a variety of societal issues inlcuding serious respiratory health issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [(Yorifuji et al., 2019)](#references) and ground-level ozone, which can lead to smog in dense urban areas [(Chang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021)](#references). SO₂ emissions are  linked to industrial activities, leading to acid rain formation that adversely affects both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems [(Yeung et al., 2021)](#references). SO₂ emissions primarily arise from the combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes. The formation of acid rain due to SO₂ emissions poses significant threats to ecosystems, affecting soil and water quality [(Oxley et al., 2013)](#references). LAU2 units provide a granular spatial resolution that allows for detailed analysis of air pollution patterns and their impacts at local scales. This level of detail is crucial for identifying specific areas that are disproportionately affected by pollutants such as NOx, NO₂, and SO₂, thereby enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Land Cover\n",
        "Dominant land cover (e.g., agriculture, built-up areas, etc.) for each LAU2 is derived from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Land Cover Map series ([LCM](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/ukceh-land-cover-maps)). The land classes we used are grouped into a simpler classification called the **UK CEH Aggregate Classes**. Understanding the primary land cover type is essential, as it can influence pollution levels and air quality in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Atmospheric Pollution\n",
        "Mean annual measurements for **NOx**, **NO₂**, and **SO₂** have been derived from the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs ([DEFRA Modelled Background Pollution Data](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/modelling-data)). We're looking at these three pollutants to explore spatial patterns and understand their impact on air quality and the environment. Each pollutant reveals a unique perspective on air quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)**: Primarily linked to vehicles, industry, and some agricultural practices. Elevated NOx levels contribute to respiratory health issues, acid rain formation, ground-level ozone, which can harm both ecosystems and human health.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**: A specific type of NOx often concentrated in urban areas with heavy traffic. Closely tied to vehicle emissions, NO₂ contributes to smog, which is why it's particularly useful to study NO₂ in relation to urban land cover, where pollution may be higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)**: Produced mainly from burning fossil fuels and certain industrial activities. SO₂ can cause acid rain and respiratory health issues, making it especially relevant in areas near industrial zones.\n",

        "### Boundaries\n",
        "The [Local Administrative Units (LAU)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/local-administrative-units) are part of a geographical classification defined by Eurostat to provide a standardised division of territorial units within the EU. Although updated post-Brexit, LAUs remain useful for historical data studies. Specifically, **LAU2** refers to the smallest administrative unit level, covering areas such as parishes, wards, or town boundaries in England and Wales.\n",
